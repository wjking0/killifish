Here I group Banana, Walter, Micro and Vinegar eels. These are useful as they are extremely easy to culture so can be ever available. They can all be cultured in a similar manner on porridge oats.
They are a good first food for many killifish fry and a good backup when your brine shrimp culture falters.
I usually mix some of these worms with my BBS prior to feeding. They will survive longer in freshwater than BBS so help to provide a more continuous feed.
