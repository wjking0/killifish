The big problem here is fungus. Fertile eggs shouldn't really fungus unless damaged. However any egg that does fungus can quickly cross-contaminate others healthy eggs. Eggs in a dish in liquid have a tendency to roll together and any fungus eggs will send out filaments that quickly snare healthy eggs.
I have a dedicated 1 litre bottle which I add a commercially available solution called fungistop (Tetra) to at 2 drops/litre. I also add a very small amount of salt to this ~1/16 teaspoon to help prevent velvet.
I store the eggs in well labelled margarine/take-away tubs. If you do see eggs going white remove them as soon as possible.
If you start to have big issues with fungus you should water incubate the eggs over a substrate (I would recommend sterilized coir). The eggs sink into the susbtrate and don't roll together with this method fungussed eggs are physically separated from good quality eggs. The only downside to this is its harder to see the eggs mature.
Another mechanism useful for egg incubation is to instead of water incubating is to store on directly onto damp peat/coir. This has several advantages (1) any mouldy eggs can easily be removed (2) You can now easily watch the eggs develop (3) If you add water when all eggs are fully developed you will get an even hatch and the fry will be of an even size which will help reduce fry on fry aggression. (4) Storing the eggs this way is also useful if you want to sell or post them as they are ready to be counted and bagged up.
If water incubating the type of container may help, having one with a larger base or a deep ridge around the base may help to separate the eggs.
