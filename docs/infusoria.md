### Introduction

Infusoria or paramecium can be tricky to culture even if you follow the recipe carefully there is a big descripency in what results you are likely to obtain.  I have found the easiest solution is to   If you wash a large bunch of this and place it in a sweet jar for a month or so.  The secret - patience, often in short supply when you have very small fish to feed.

### Method

1. Buy or find a large quantity of Sphagnum moss.  It can be bought at florists as it is used for hanging baskets.
2. Wash the Sphagnum moss thoroughly in cold tap water.
3. Fill a sweet jar with it nd add water to the top, add the lid to the sweet jar (as it does get smelly).
4. After about a month you should start to see Infusoria 'swimming' at the surface.
5. With this setup the Infusoria can be harvested continuosly for at least several months.
