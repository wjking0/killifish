### Introduction

Infusoria or paramecium are quite easy. The secret - patience, often in short supply when you have very small fish to feed.

### Method

1. Take a small piece of black/dried banana skin ~1/10 of the whole skin.
2. Add to ~200ml of tank water perhaps with some aquarium algae or duck weed added in a clear container.
3. Leave/forget it on a window sill for ~7 days.
4. Any cloudy liquid (bacteria) should now have cleared and infusoria should be visible with the help from some magnification.
