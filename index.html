                <p>dos and don't of killi-keeping:</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>Sadly Killifish are rarely seen in the Local Fish Shop (LFS). This gives rise to the impression that they are somehow difficult to keep and breed which is far from the truth. In many ways Killifish are the perfect aquarium fish.
Unlike the vast majority of Aquarium fish they are adapted to live in very small bodies of water making them ideal to keep in tanks. They are generally happy to breed in a wider range of conditions than other groups of fish.
The reason for the paucity of Killifish in the LFS is that they are difficult to culture in the large numbers on fish farms to make them commercially viable so seldom reach the LFS from their usual sources.
The fry of starter species are often quite large and can thrive at room temperature in small pots without the need for heaters or filtration.
Rather than having large clutches, Killifish produce a steady stream of eggs over their lifetime. This allows the breeder to adapt their techniques without catastrophic loss of all their fry. It also means they don't have to suddenly house large numbers of fish or have lots of empty tanks waiting for their fry to grow out.
With literally 1000s of species to choose from Killifish culture can be an interest to last a lifetime. The real joy in keeping killifish is the breeding and raising of fish and Killifish are a great group for home fish culture.
Rule Number 1 for Killifish has to be to use a tight lid on all tanks and containers. Most killies are adept escape artists and every killie keeper has a sad tale of a prize pair of killies being lost to this miss-hap.
You have been warned learn the lesson quickly. Thankfully the issue can easily be prevented with sellotape and cut plastic.</p>
<h2 id="baby-brine-shrimp-bbs">Baby Brine Shrimp (BBS):</h2>
<p>You are hopefully going to be raising many fry, get familiar with BBS culture as this will be a mainstay for you.
You can create a homemade hatchery if you are handy, however as this is such a critical piece of equipment you maybe better served to buy a commercial solution e.g. JBLs Brine shrimp hatchery.
Get 2 and alternate the feeding from each. I have a little red cap that I hang on the next hatchery to use as it takes over 24 hours for the eggs to hatch and you need to be feeding daily if you can.
The critical part with BBS is getting high quality eggs. You can buy none-viable eggs used as a food in their own right, you obviously don't want these.
When the eggs arrive, you need to aliquot them into smaller sealed bags and store them in a sealed glass jar in a freezer. The eggs need to stay dry so add some uncooked rice or water absorbing packets to the jar.
The active sealed-bag of eggs should be kept in the fridge again within a small sealed jar with rice.
I use 3 teaspoons of salt per 500ml Hatchery and dissolve in regular tap water. While you might get away with using table salt it is better to use a purer salt e.g. sea salt. The salt water can be reused for several days depending on the numbers of shrimp being hatched. Steady but not too strong air flow is required. Optionally you can add a led light (24hrs) that will improve hatch rate.</p>
<h2 id="fry-worms">Fry worms:</h2>
<p>Here I group Banana, Walter, Micro and Vinegar eels. These are useful as they are extremely easy to culture so can be ever available.
They are a good first food for many killifish fry and a good backup when your brine shrimp culture falters.
I usually mix some of these worms with my BBS for feeding to most fry. They will survive longer in freshwater than BBS so help to provide a more continuous feed.</p>
<h2 id="feeding-adults">Feeding Adults:</h2>
<p>Flightless fruit fly, white worms, grindal worms, Daphnia, Bloodworms, Tubifex, frozen food, good quality fish pellets. Are all happily taken by the adults.
A varied diet is always good and live foods are needed to condition the fish for breeding. Worms are probably best for this.
Live food culture is a topic on its own and outside the topic here. It is worth joining the live food Facebook group.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-breeding-fish">Choosing breeding fish:</h2>
<p>You will often find you get more eggs from a single pair of fish than a trio (male + 2 females), reverse-trio (2 males and 1 female) or a group.
I'm not sure if this because of the simple dynamic of having more fish in the tank means territories are set the fish spend less time laying eggs and more time courting/chasing/fighting i.e. establishing a territory. It could also be due to the eggs being eaten by none-breeding fish. Or likely a combination of these effects.
For an averaged sized adult pair you need a tank or Plastic container of ~ 15L. Males are usually very territorial to other males and to females. Having some good hiding places for the female is extremely important to keep her healthy. I find using leaves a great help here. Not only do the replicate their natural environment but females can easily slip away from an overly amorous male. You could add many mops however it does make hunting for eggs more of a chore. I have added clay pots and floating/sinking plastic tubes but unlike Cichlids, Killifish aren't especially fond of going in them, but they will lay next to them.
Ideally you want young adults most Killifish mature between 7-11 months of age.</p>
<h2 id="mops">Mops:</h2>
<p>Use acrylic wool, not real wool, it will rot. Colour isn't really that important. You may find some colours are easier for you to see the eggs in.
Try to keep mops clean. After 2-3 months when they start to smell (a) Fish won't lay eggs in them and (b) any eggs that are laid are more likely to go moldy.
At this stage wash the mop thoroughly in very hot tap water the clourine and heat will help to decontaminate the mops. This should be good enough to refeshen up the mops for re-use.
Using very hot tap water will also kill any unfound eggs so you can use the mop again with a different species if needed.</p>
<h2 id="annuals">Annuals:</h2>
<p>IMO I would suggest to avoid trying annuals until you are familiar with non-annuals. You may get lucky and find you are a dab-hand with them, but I suspect most annual keepers have been keeping killifish for some time and started on non-annuals.
If you do try annuals get the eggs from a reliable source. Someone on Aquabid who apppears to be a popular seller or a BKA/AKA club seller. Unfortunately there are people who will be happy to sell you bags of peat.
I would also suggest starting on species that have short incubation times (~2 months) and produce large fry. e.g. Nothobranchius guentheri.</p>
<h2 id="water">Water:</h2>
<p>Whilst having a well or using rainwater maybe ideal. Many of us don't have this luxury. Also using rainwater can be more variable than tap water over a year, especially if leaves and other debris can get into the water butt. Many commoner killifish aren't that fussy and clean treated tap water will often suffice if all other elements are optimal.
My theory is if you get 90% of conditions right for your fish they are likely to breed.
If they are the right age, in an appropriate temperature well fed with clean water, conditions such as hardness, pH etc.. which are much much harder to control can be ignored.
There are obviously exceptions to this on a species to species level.</p>
<h2 id="fry-containers">Fry Containers:</h2>
<p>I used to use chinese take-away tubs, I liked the fact they were free easy to source. It is labour intensing keeping many small containers clean.
Perhaps a better option are small 2l plastic containers.</p>

<h2 id="sourcing-fish">Sourcing fish:</h2>
<h2 id="light">Light:</h2>
<p>Whilst in the wild many of the Killifish you will be keeping are from small dark wet pools under leaves or crevices in Rainforests.
The advantages of using lights means you can keep plants with your fish that will help to keep the water clear and reduce the need for water changes.
The fish generally quickly get used to the lighting, the light keeps the plants healthy which in turnit also means you can watch your pride and joys, enjoy their behaviour and spot when their are any issues.
nd can be kept in this way without lights. I find that they are usually quite happy to be lit.
LED light strips are today easy to use and setup.</p>
<h2 id="plants">Plants:</h2>
<p>Fry tubs should have plants in ideally java moss, also najas, duck weed (other floating plants), hornwort, Egeria densa, Elodea,
Also Snails are you friend at this stage (ramshorns, trumpets, bladder snail) they will eat any uneaten food and their poo is easy to siphon out.
Terrestial plants are also great as they can help to keep the improve water quality useful terrestrial plants might be - Pothos (very easy), Sweet potato, Ivy, lucky bamboo.</p>
<h2 id="diving-for-pearls">Diving for Pearls:</h2>
<p>Equipment: Light, strong glasses 3.00-5.00 magnification, eye-brow tweezers. It is always exciting finding eggs. It does take some adjustment to get your eye. Whilst killifish eggs are usually hard enough to be touched by hand, this is not recommended as our fingers are likely to transfer fungus spores.
It is quite easy to pick eggs with eye-brow tweezers. These are tweezers that curve together at the tip. Hooking the egg between the tweezers it can be gently teazed from the yarn.</p>
<h2 id="egg-incubation">Egg incubation:</h2>
<p>The big problem here is fungus. Fertile eggs shouldn't really fungus unless damaged, however one unfertile/damaged egg that does fungus can cross-contaminate others easily.
I have a 1 litre bottle. and use a commercially available solution called fungistop (Tetra). 2 drops per litre. I also add a very small amount of salt to this ~1/16 teaspoon to help prevent velvet.
I store the eggs in well labelled margarine type tubs. If you do see eggs going white remove them as soon as possible.
Eggs generally have a tendency to roll together and will stick together when fungus is present this is very bad news and upsetting. If this starts to happen you can incubate the eggs on a substrate (I can recommend sterilized coir). The eggs sink into the susbtrate and don't roll together. Any fungussed eggs are kept separated from good quality eggs.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment:</h2>
<p>Brine Shrimp Hatchery, Brine shrimp sieve, Airline, airline taps - get many and use them liberally, airpump, Glasses 3.00-5.00 magnification, 2 eye-brow tweezers one for picking eggs, one for picking worms. Small paint brushes,
Margarine tubs, Acrylic yarn, corks, Fingistop, turkey baster (for fry tank cleaning). Nano tank siphon. Small paint brushes, pippettes, small net.</p>
<h2 id="consumables">Consumables:</h2>
<p>Labels (small and large) - used to label species names, number of eggs collected, when last cleaned.</p>
